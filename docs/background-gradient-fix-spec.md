# Background Gradient Fix Specification

## Overview
The current background gradients on the site are being clipped at the top and bottom, preventing full coverage of the display area. This specification outlines the requirements and implementation plan to ensure the gradient covers the entire visible area, including the status bar on mobile devices and areas above the navigation bar, while maintaining the glass-like navigation.

## Problem Statement
- Background gradients are applied to specific sections (e.g., contact page, hero section) but do not extend to the full viewport height.
- On mobile devices, the status bar and area above the navigation bar are not covered by the gradient.
- The navigation bar is glass-like but the background clipping affects the overall visual consistency.
- Users expect the gradient to be visible across all scroll views without interruption.

## Requirements
1. **Full-Screen Coverage**: The background gradient must cover the entire display area, including:
   - Status bar on mobile devices.
   - Area above the navigation bar.
   - Full viewport height on all devices.
2. **Navigation Bar**: Maintain the existing glass-like appearance (backdrop-blur with transparency) without clipping the background.
3. **Consistency**: Use the existing `liquid-background` class or similar gradient for uniformity across pages.
4. **Theme Support**: Ensure compatibility with light and dark themes.
5. **Scroll Views**: Gradient should remain visible and non-clipped during scrolling.

## Current Implementation Analysis
- Gradients are defined in `app/globals.css` as `.liquid-background` with animated linear gradients.
- Applied in pages like `app/contact/page.tsx` and `components/features/hero/HeroSection.tsx`.
- Layout in `app/layout.tsx` has a main div with `bg-background` and padding for navigation.
- Navigation bar is fixed with glass styling.

## Proposed Solution
1. **Apply Gradient to Body**: Update `app/globals.css` to set the body background to the gradient instead of solid color.
2. **Adjust Layout**: Modify `app/layout.tsx` to ensure the main content area allows full viewport coverage.
3. **Integrate Liquid Background**: Ensure `liquid-background` is applied globally or per page as needed.
4. **Mobile Considerations**: Use CSS properties like `height: 100vh` to cover status bar on mobile.

## Implementation Steps
1. Update `body` styles in `app/globals.css` to use the gradient background.
2. Remove or adjust `bg-background` from the main div in `app/layout.tsx`.
3. Add `liquid-background` to the body or main container.
4. Test on various devices and browsers.
5. Verify navigation remains glass-like and non-obstructive.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Gradient covers full screen including status bar and above navigation.
- Navigation bar is glass-like and does not clip the background.
- No visual artifacts during scrolling.
- Consistent across light and dark themes.
- Tested on mobile and desktop.

## Risks and Considerations
- Ensure performance is not impacted by background animations.
- Check for accessibility issues with backdrop-blur.
- Verify compatibility with existing components.
