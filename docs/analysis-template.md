## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Animation Performance:** Liquid glass effects may impact mobile performance
  - **Mitigation:** Adaptive animation intensity based on device capability
- **Theme System Complexity:** Dual theme implementation with smooth transitions
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing across devices and browsers

### Implementation Risks
- **Epic 1 Dependencies:** Epic 2 features depend on foundation completion
  - **Mitigation:** Parallel development where possible, clear dependency management
- **Content Dependencies:** Feature implementation needs actual content
  - **Mitigation:** Use placeholder content during development, replace with real content

### Schedule Risks
- **Sequential Dependencies:** Epic 1 must precede most Epic 2 work
  - **Mitigation:** Start Epic 2 stories that are ready (2.3-2.6) immediately

## Success Metrics

### Foundation Success Criteria
- **Design System:** All liquid glass components render correctly in both themes
- **Performance:** Bundle size < 500KB, 60fps animations, < 2s load time
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validated
- **Responsive Design:** All breakpoints function correctly

### Feature Success Criteria
- **Content Management:** Articles and projects load and filter correctly
- **User Experience:** Theme switching and navigation work smoothly
- **Search & Social:** Content discovery and sharing functions properly
- **Contact Integration:** Form submission and LinkedIn display work correctly

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Complete Design System** - Finish Story 1.2 implementation
2. **Start Content Features** - Begin Stories 2.3-2.6 development
3. **Content Preparation** - Gather project data and articles for implementation
4. **Testing Setup** - Configure development testing environment

### Quality Gates
1. **Foundation Gate:** All Epic 1 stories completed and tested
2. **Feature Gate:** Stories 2.3-2.6 implemented and validated
3. **Performance Gate:** NFR001 (2s load time) and NFR002 (99.9% uptime) achieved
4. **Accessibility Gate:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validated

### Handoff Considerations
- **Development Team:** Ready for Epic 1 completion and Epic 2 implementation
- **Content Team:** Prepare portfolio projects and BMAD articles
- **Testing Team:** Accessibility and performance testing protocols established
