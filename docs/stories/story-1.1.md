# Story 1.1: Project Structure Setup with Next.js 15 and TypeScript

Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want to set up a modern Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and liquid glass design system foundation, so that I can establish a solid technical foundation for the portfolio website with optimal performance and developer experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js 15 project initializes without errors
2. TypeScript strict mode enabled and passing
3. ESLint and Prettier configured with project standards
4. Development server starts and hot reload functions
5. Basic routing structure implemented for all planned pages

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and App Router configuration
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
  - [ ] Configure App Router structure for all planned pages (about, portfolio, articles, crypto, contact)
  - [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier with project standards [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#Technology Stack]
- [ ] Configure development environment and tooling
  - [ ] Install required dependencies (Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React)
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript for strict mode compliance
  - [ ] Set up development server with hot reload functionality
  - [ ] Create basic project structure with component directories
- [ ] Implement liquid glass design system foundation
  - [ ] Create CSS custom properties system for glassmorphism tokens
  - [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism utility classes
  - [ ] Create foundational GlassCard component with backdrop-filter effects
  - [ ] Configure theme system foundation for light/dark modes
- [ ] Set up state management solution
  - [ ] Implement React Context for theme management
  - [ ] Set up navigation state management
  - [ ] Configure content state structure for portfolio data
- [ ] Testing framework setup
  - [ ] Install React Testing Library and Jest
  - [ ] Configure testing environment for component testing
  - [ ] Set up Playwright for E2E testing foundation
  - [ ] Create basic test structure for design system components

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Modular monolith with Next.js App Router for optimal SEO and performance
  - CSS Modules + Tailwind hybrid styling for glassmorphism effects
  - React Context for lightweight state management
  - File-based content architecture using markdown files
- Source tree components to touch
  - app/ directory structure with all page routes
  - components/design-system/ for foundational components
  - lib/ for utilities and configurations
  - types/ for TypeScript definitions
  - styles/ for global CSS and theme definitions
- Testing standards summary
  - Unit tests for components using React Testing Library (90% coverage target)
  - Integration tests for theme switching and navigation
  - E2E tests for critical user paths using Playwright
  - Accessibility testing with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Follow Next.js App Router conventions in app/ directory
  - Component organization: design-system, layout, features pattern
  - Content structure using markdown files in content/ directory
  - Asset organization in public/images/ for project screenshots
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project has basic Next.js structure but missing glassmorphism implementation
  - Need to add design-system components not yet present
  - Content directory structure needs to be created for portfolio data
  - Styles directory needs theme system implementation
