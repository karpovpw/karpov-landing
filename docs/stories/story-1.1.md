# Story 1.1: Project Structure Setup

Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want to establish the Next.js 15 project structure with TypeScript configuration and development environment setup, so that the team has a solid technical foundation for implementing the liquid glass design system and portfolio features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC001: Project Structure Setup**
   - Next.js 15 project initializes without errors
   - TypeScript strict mode enabled and passing
   - ESLint and Prettier configured with project standards
   - Development server starts and hot reload functions
   - Basic routing structure implemented for all planned pages

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC001): Set up Next.js 15 project structure
  - [x] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
  - [x] Configure package.json with required dependencies and scripts
  - [x] Set up project directory structure following architecture guidelines
  - [x] Create basic folder structure (app/, components/, lib/, types/, styles/)
  - [x] Configure TypeScript with strict mode and project-specific settings
- [ ] Task 2 (AC001): Configure development environment
  - [ ] Set up ESLint configuration with Next.js recommended rules
  - [ ] Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
  - [ ] Set up PostCSS with Tailwind CSS integration
  - [ ] Create development scripts and build configuration
  - [ ] Validate development server startup and hot reloading
- [ ] Task 3 (AC001): Implement basic routing structure
  - [ ] Create app router structure for all planned pages (about, portfolio, articles, crypto, contact)
  - [ ] Set up root layout with basic navigation structure
  - [ ] Configure globals.css for global styling foundation
  - [ ] Create placeholder page components for each route
  - [ ] Test routing functionality and page rendering

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Next.js 15 App Router architecture provides optimal performance and SEO for portfolio
  - TypeScript strict mode ensures type safety for custom component library complexity
  - Modular monolith pattern with clear separation of concerns for maintainability
  - Server-side rendering strategy for optimal portfolio content presentation

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/app/` - Next.js App Router structure and page layouts
  - `/components/` - Shared component library foundation
  - `/lib/` - Utilities and shared logic configuration
  - `/types/` - TypeScript type definitions for content models
  - `/styles/` - Global styles and CSS architecture

- Testing standards summary
  - Unit tests for component library with React Testing Library
  - Integration tests for routing and navigation functionality
  - Accessibility testing for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance foundation
  - Performance testing for Core Web Vitals optimization

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Next.js App Router structure provides clear separation between pages and components
  - Component library organization follows atomic design principles for maintainability
  - TypeScript interfaces establish content models for Epic 2 consumption
  - CSS architecture supports glassmorphism effects and theme switching requirements

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - initial project setup aligns with architecture specifications
  - Component library structure will be expanded in subsequent stories
  - Content management approach uses markdown files as specified in architecture
