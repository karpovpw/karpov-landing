# Story 1.1: Project Structure Setup

Status: Draft

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **to establish a modern web framework foundation with Next.js 15 and TypeScript**,
so that **I can build a performant, maintainable portfolio with liquid glass design effects**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js 15 project initializes without errors [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC001]
2. TypeScript strict mode enabled and passing [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC001]
3. ESLint and Prettier configured with project standards [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC001]
4. Development server starts and hot reload functions [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC001]
5. Basic routing structure implemented for all planned pages [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC001]
6. Cross-browser compatibility validated (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) [Source: docs/PRD.md#NFR003]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Set up project structure with App Router
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript 5.6.x with strict mode
  - [ ] Install core dependencies (Next.js 15.0.0, React 19.0.0-rc)
- [ ] Configure development environment and tooling (AC: #2, #3, #4)
  - [ ] Set up ESLint 9.x with Next.js recommended configuration
  - [ ] Configure Prettier 3.x for code formatting
  - [ ] Set up development server with hot reload
  - [ ] Create basic npm scripts (dev, build, lint, format)
- [ ] Implement basic routing structure (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Create app directory structure with layout.tsx
  - [ ] Set up basic pages (home, about, portfolio, articles, crypto, contact)
  - [ ] Configure root layout with navigation structure
  - [ ] Implement basic page.tsx for home route
- [ ] Set up state management foundation (AC: #1, #5)
  - [ ] Create basic React Context for theme management
  - [ ] Set up project constants and configuration
  - [ ] Prepare foundation for glassmorphism components

## Dev Notes

- Follow modular monolith pattern with Next.js App Router [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#2.1-Architecture-Pattern]
- Implement hybrid SSR strategy for optimal portfolio performance [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#2.2-Server-Side-Rendering-Strategy]
- Use App Router structure with planned navigation components [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#2.3-Page-Routing-and-Navigation]
- Configure Node.js 20.17.x as runtime environment [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#1.1-Technology-Decision-Table]

### Project Structure Notes

- Follow proposed source tree structure exactly [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#14-Proposed-Source-Tree]
- Create app/ directory for Next.js App Router implementation
- Set up components/ directory for shared component library
- Prepare content/ directory for portfolio data (markdown files)
- Initialize lib/ directory for utilities and configurations
- Set up public/ directory for static assets and images
