## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Contact system serves as primary conversion point for professional opportunities
  - Form handling must balance security with user experience
  - LinkedIn integration provides credible professional networking
  - Social sharing extends portfolio reach and network effects
  - API integrations must handle rate limits and error states gracefully

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Main contact form interface
  - `/components/contact/LinkedInCard.tsx` - LinkedIn profile display component
  - `/components/contact/SocialShare.tsx` - Social sharing button component
  - `/app/contact/page.tsx` - Contact page implementation
  - `/app/api/contact/route.ts` - Form submission API endpoint
  - `/lib/validations/contact.ts` - Form validation schemas

- Testing standards summary
  - Form validation and submission functionality testing
  - LinkedIn integration reliability and error handling
  - Social sharing button effectiveness and analytics
  - Cross-platform compatibility for contact features
  - Security testing for form submission and rate limiting

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Contact Module structure supports professional networking and conversion
  - Component architecture follows feature-based organization for Epic 2
  - API routes organized for form handling and external integrations
  - Responsive implementation leverages Epic 1's design system foundation

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - contact implementation builds naturally on existing component library
  - Glassmorphism design enhances professional presentation and credibility
  - External integrations designed with fallback patterns for reliability
