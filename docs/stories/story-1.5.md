# Story 1.5: Performance Optimization

Status: Draft

## Story

As a performance engineer, I want to implement comprehensive performance optimization strategies including code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and caching mechanisms, so that I can ensure the portfolio website loads within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections and maintains 60fps animations throughout the user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Code splitting implemented at route and component levels for optimal bundle sizes
2. Image optimization configured for WebP/AVIF formats with responsive sizing
3. Bundle analyzer shows < 500KB gzipped JavaScript target achieved
4. Lazy loading implemented for below-fold content and heavy components
5. Performance budgets enforced in build process with automated monitoring
6. Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) tracked and optimized for excellent scores

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
  - [ ] Set up route-based code splitting for all page components
  - [ ] Implement component-level lazy loading for heavy UI elements
  - [ ] Configure dynamic imports for article content and project details
  - [ ] Set up lazy loading for Framer Motion animations and heavy libraries
- [ ] Set up image optimization and WebP support
  - [ ] Configure Next.js Image component for all project screenshots
  - [ ] Implement WebP/AVIF generation with fallbacks for older browsers
  - [ ] Set up responsive image sizing with appropriate breakpoints
  - [ ] Create image loading states and blur placeholder effects
- [ ] Configure caching strategies
  - [ ] Implement browser caching headers for static assets
  - [ ] Set up service worker for offline capability and asset caching
  - [ ] Configure CDN caching with appropriate cache headers
  - [ ] Implement build-time caching for static content generation
- [ ] Monitor and optimize loading performance
  - [ ] Set up performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking
  - [ ] Implement bundle analyzer with 500KB gzipped target enforcement
  - [ ] Create performance regression tests for continuous monitoring
  - [ ] Set up automated performance reporting and alerts

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Code splitting at route and component levels for optimal performance
  - Image optimization with modern formats and responsive sizing
  - Service worker implementation for offline capability
  - Performance budgets and monitoring for continuous optimization
- Source tree components to touch
  - next.config.js for performance optimizations and image configuration
  - Components with dynamic imports for lazy loading implementation
  - Public assets with optimized images and caching headers
  - Build scripts for performance monitoring and bundle analysis
- Testing standards summary
  - Performance testing for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) optimization
  - Bundle analysis testing with size targets and regression detection
  - Image optimization testing across different formats and devices
  - Caching strategy testing for reliability and performance gains

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Performance optimizations integrated into Next.js configuration
  - Image assets organized in public/images/ with optimization pipeline
  - Build process includes performance monitoring and bundle analysis
  - Caching strategies follow Next.js and CDN best practices
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project structure supports performance optimizations well
  - Need to implement image optimization pipeline for project screenshots
  - Bundle analysis and performance monitoring need to be added to build process
