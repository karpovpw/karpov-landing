# Story 1.5: Performance Optimization

Status: Draft

## Story

As a user, I want the portfolio website to load quickly and perform smoothly with optimized images and efficient caching, so that I can access and navigate the content without delays or performance issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC005: Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting implemented at route and component levels
   - Image optimization configured for WebP/AVIF formats
   - Bundle analyzer shows < 500KB gzipped target
   - Lazy loading implemented for below-fold content
   - Performance budgets enforced in build process

  - [ ] Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic content
  - [ ] Configure CDN caching headers for optimal performance
  - [ ] Set up service worker for offline capability and caching
  - [ ] Implement browser caching strategies for static assets

- [ ] Task 5 (AC005): Establish performance monitoring and budgets
  - [ ] Set up performance budgets in build process (< 500KB JS target)
  - [ ] Implement Core Web Vitals tracking and monitoring
  - [ ] Configure performance analytics and user interaction tracking
  - [ ] Set up automated performance testing and bundle analysis
  - [ ] Create performance regression detection for CI/CD pipeline

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Bundle optimization ensures sub-2-second load times on standard broadband
  - Code splitting prevents large initial bundle sizes while maintaining functionality
  - Image optimization supports multiple formats for optimal loading across devices
  - Performance monitoring ensures consistent user experience quality

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/lib/performance.ts` - Performance monitoring and Core Web Vitals tracking
  - `/components/loading/` - Loading states and skeleton components for perceived performance
  - Next.js configuration files for code splitting and image optimization
  - `/public/images/` - Optimized project screenshots and photos with multiple formats
  - Bundle analyzer configuration for build process monitoring

- Testing standards summary
  - Performance testing for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) compliance
  - Bundle size analysis and regression testing for < 500KB target
  - Image optimization testing across different formats and breakpoints
  - Cross-browser performance testing for consistency
  - Load time testing under various network conditions

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Performance Layer integration supports build-time and runtime optimizations
  - Image optimization aligns with responsive layout breakpoints from Story 1.4
  - Code splitting works seamlessly with existing component architecture
  - Caching strategies integrate with Next.js App Router structure from Story 1.1

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - performance optimization enhances existing architecture
  - Code splitting improves initial load performance for glassmorphism components
  - Image optimization supports responsive design requirements across breakpoints
