### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

âœ… Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Evidence: Story statement extracted from story-2.3.md: "As a visitor interested in BMAD methodologies and technical insights, I want to browse, filter, and read articles with proper markdown rendering and reading time estimates, so that I can easily discover and consume the technical content that demonstrates thought leadership and expertise."
Impact: Perfect user-centric story context captured for BMAD content discovery and technical thought leadership

âœ… Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Evidence: AC208, AC209, AC210, AC211 from story draft match requirements exactly: "Article cards display with consistent glassmorphism styling and metadata", "Article detail view renders markdown content correctly", "Reading time estimates calculate and display accurately", "Article content loads from markdown files efficiently", "BMAD content categorization works correctly"
Impact: Ensures implementation fidelity to articles management system requirements

âœ… Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Evidence: Complete 5-task breakdown provided: "Task 1: Implement article listing and grid layout", "Task 2: Develop article card components with metadata", "Task 3: Build comprehensive article detail view", "Task 4: Implement enhanced reading experience features", "Task 5: Set up content management and SEO optimization" with detailed subtasks
Impact: Comprehensive implementation roadmap for articles management and content system development

âœ… Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Evidence: 4 key source documents included with paths and relevant content: epic-stories.md (articles management requirements), PRD.md (content browsing and filtering requirements), solution-architecture.md (content module and article system), complete Epic 1 and Stories 2.1-2.2 foundation
Impact: Comprehensive documentation context for articles management system implementation

âœ… Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Evidence: Specific implementation locations identified: "/components/content/ArticleList.tsx", "/components/content/ArticleCard.tsx", "/components/content/ArticleReader.tsx", "/components/content/ArticleFilter.tsx", "/content/articles/"
Impact: Clear target locations for article system code implementation with feature-based organization

âœ… Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
Evidence: Content system interfaces documented: "Markdown processing and glassmorphism content cards", "Progress tracking and smooth scroll navigation", "Topic-based filtering with animation", "High-performance markdown rendering with syntax highlighting"
Impact: Critical content management interfaces identified for article system development

âœ… Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
Evidence: Content management constraints captured: "Article system serves as primary thought leadership and technical content showcase", "Content management approach supports easy article authoring and publishing", "Markdown rendering must maintain performance while providing rich formatting", "SEO optimization critical for content discovery and professional visibility"
Impact: Essential content development constraints and publishing patterns properly documented

âœ… Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Evidence: Implementation dependencies identified: "Complete Epic 1 foundation ready for content system implementation", "Stories 2.1-2.2 user interface foundation for content presentation", "Content Module component architecture with feature-based organization", "Markdown processing system with performance optimization", "Responsive grid system integration for article layout"
Impact: Complete dependency matrix for articles management system implementation

âœ… Testing standards and locations populated
Evidence: Content system testing requirements clearly specified: "Content rendering testing for markdown parsing and syntax highlighting accuracy", "Filter functionality testing for topic and date filtering effectiveness", "Reading experience testing for user journey and content consumption", "Performance testing for article loading and content rendering speed", "Accessibility testing for article content and navigation structures"
Impact: Comprehensive content management testing strategy and standards defined for article system validation

âœ… XML structure follows story-context template format
Evidence: Proper XML structure with story_context root element, story metadata, context sections, source_documents, and implementation_guidance - follows standard template format with articles management and Epic 2-specific content
Impact: Consistent documentation structure for tool integration and content system guidance

## Failed Items
None - all items passed validation

## Partial Items
