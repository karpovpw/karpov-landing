# Story 1.3: Theme System Implementation

Status: Draft

## Story

As a user, I want to seamlessly switch between light and dark themes with smooth transitions and persistent preferences, so that I can use the portfolio comfortably in any lighting condition and maintain my preferred visual experience across sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC003: Theme Switching Functionality**
   - ThemeProvider context manages global theme state
   - Light theme (white/purple gradient) renders correctly
   - Dark theme (AMOLED black) renders correctly
   - Theme switching transitions smoothly (< 200ms)
   - Theme preference persists across browser sessions
   - Neon accent colors (green/orange) apply correctly in both themes

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC003): Create ThemeProvider context and state management
  - [ ] Implement ThemeProvider React context with theme state management
  - [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for theme configuration and state
  - [ ] Build theme context provider with React Context API
  - [ ] Implement theme state initialization from localStorage/system preferences
  - [ ] Add theme context to app root layout for global availability

- [x] Task 2 (AC003): Implement light theme (white/purple gradient)
  - [ ] Create light theme CSS custom properties and color tokens
  - [ ] Implement white background with purple gradient accents
  - [ ] Configure glassmorphism effects for light theme environment
  - [ ] Set up proper contrast ratios for light theme readability
  - [ ] Test light theme integration with existing glassmorphism components

- [x] Task 3 (AC003): Implement dark theme (AMOLED black)
  - [ ] Create dark theme CSS custom properties with AMOLED black background
  - [ ] Implement neon accent colors (green/orange) for dark theme
  - [ ] Configure glassmorphism effects optimized for dark environments
  - [ ] Ensure high contrast ratios for dark theme accessibility
  - [ ] Test dark theme integration with glassmorphism design system

- [x] Task 4 (AC003): Build theme switching mechanism and smooth transitions
  - [ ] Create ThemeToggle component with glassmorphism styling
  - [ ] Implement smooth theme transition animations (< 200ms)
  - [ ] Add theme toggle to navigation header component
  - [ ] Ensure FOUC prevention during theme switching
  - [ ] Test theme transitions across different glassmorphism components

- [x] Task 5 (AC003): Implement theme persistence across sessions
  - [ ] Add localStorage persistence for theme preferences
  - [ ] Implement system theme preference detection
  - [ ] Create theme preference management utilities
  - [ ] Add persistence across browser sessions and devices
  - [ ] Validate theme preferences survive browser restarts

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - React Context API provides optimal global state management for theme system
  - CSS custom properties enable runtime theme switching without component re-renders
  - Glassmorphism effects require theme-specific backdrop-filter optimizations
  - Theme persistence ensures consistent user experience across sessions

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/components/design-system/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Core theme context and state management
  - `/components/design-system/ThemeToggle.tsx` - User interface for theme switching
  - `/styles/themes.css` - Theme-specific CSS custom properties and styling
  - `/lib/theme-utils.ts` - Theme management utilities and localStorage persistence
  - `/types/theme.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for theme configuration

- Testing standards summary
  - Unit tests for ThemeProvider context and state management
  - Integration tests for theme switching functionality across components
  - Visual testing for smooth theme transitions and glassmorphism effects
  - Accessibility testing for contrast ratios in both themes
  - Persistence testing for theme preferences across browser sessions

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Design System Module structure supports theme management as a core component
  - CSS architecture enables seamless theme switching through custom properties
  - Component organization follows atomic design with theme as a foundational element
  - State management integrates cleanly with existing React Context patterns

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - theme system implementation aligns with architecture specifications
  - CSS custom properties approach enables efficient runtime theme switching
  - Context provider pattern provides optimal global theme state management
