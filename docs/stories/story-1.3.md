# Story 1.3: Theme System Implementation

Status: Draft

## Story

As a user interface developer, I want to implement a comprehensive theme switching system supporting dark/black themes with liquid glass effects, so that I can provide users with an optimal viewing experience across different lighting conditions and preferences while maintaining the portfolio's visual identity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ThemeProvider context manages global theme state with light and dark mode support
2. Light theme (white/purple gradient) renders correctly with glassmorphism effects
3. Dark theme (AMOLED black) renders correctly with enhanced glassmorphism visibility
4. Theme switching transitions smoothly (< 200ms) without visual artifacts
5. Theme preference persists across browser sessions using localStorage
6. Neon accent colors (green/orange) apply correctly in both theme modes

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Build theme context and provider
  - [ ] Create ThemeProvider React context with theme state management
  - [ ] Implement useTheme hook for component consumption
  - [ ] Set up theme type definitions and interfaces
  - [ ] Create theme initialization logic with system preference detection
- [ ] Create dark/black theme switching mechanism
  - [ ] Implement light theme with white/purple gradient color scheme
  - [ ] Build AMOLED black theme for enhanced dark experience
  - [ ] Create theme toggle component with smooth transitions
  - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for theme switching (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T)
- [ ] Implement smooth theme transitions
  - [ ] Create CSS transition system for theme switching (< 200ms)
  - [ ] Implement theme-aware CSS custom properties for glassmorphism
  - [ ] Add loading states to prevent FOUC during theme changes
  - [ ] Optimize transitions for reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Ensure theme persistence across sessions
  - [ ] Implement localStorage-based theme preference storage
  - [ ] Create theme persistence across browser restarts
  - [ ] Add theme synchronization across multiple tabs
  - [ ] Handle localStorage unavailability gracefully
- [ ] Testing framework for theme system
  - [ ] Create unit tests for ThemeProvider context functionality
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for theme switching transitions
  - [ ] Set up visual regression tests for both theme modes
  - [ ] Add accessibility tests for theme contrast compliance

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - React Context pattern for global theme state management
  - CSS custom properties for dynamic theme variable switching
  - localStorage-based persistence with fallback strategies
  - Reduced motion support for accessibility compliance
- Source tree components to touch
  - components/design-system/ThemeProvider.tsx for theme context
  - components/design-system/ThemeToggle.tsx for user interaction
  - styles/themes.css for theme-specific styling definitions
  - lib/theme-utils.ts for theme management utilities
- Testing standards summary
  - Unit tests for theme context and hooks (90% coverage target)
  - Integration tests for theme switching and persistence
  - Visual regression tests for theme consistency across components
  - Accessibility tests ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA contrast compliance

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Theme system integrated into design-system module structure
  - CSS variables organized in global theme files for consistency
  - Theme utilities follow established lib/ directory patterns
  - Context providers properly integrated with app layout structure
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project has basic Tailwind setup but missing theme system implementation
  - Need to extend CSS architecture with theme-aware custom properties
  - Component structure needs theme context integration for glassmorphism effects
