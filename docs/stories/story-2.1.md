# Story 2.1: Personal Profile & Hero

Status: Draft

## Story

As a portfolio visitor, I want to view a compelling hero section with professional introduction, personal bio, and skills showcase, so that I can quickly understand the developer's expertise, background, and unique value proposition while being engaged by smooth animations and liquid glass design elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Hero section displays professional photo with liquid glass frame effects
2. Personal description and bio section presents background and expertise clearly
3. Skills and expertise showcase highlights technical competencies with visual indicators
4. Animated introduction elements load smoothly without performance impact
5. Hero content adapts responsively across all device sizes with touch-friendly interactions
6. Professional call-to-action encourages portfolio exploration and contact

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Hero section as main entry point with progressive content disclosure
  - Glassmorphism design integration with personal branding elements
  - Performance-optimized animations with hardware acceleration
  - Responsive design ensuring consistent experience across devices
- Source tree components to touch
  - components/hero/ for main hero section and animations
  - components/profile/ for bio and skills showcase components
  - public/images/profile/ for professional photos and assets
  - lib/animations/hero-animations.ts for custom motion effects
- Testing standards summary
  - Hero section rendering and animation performance testing
  - Responsive layout testing across 6 breakpoints
  - Accessibility testing for professional photo alt text and ARIA labels
  - Animation performance testing ensuring 60fps across devices

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Hero components organized in components/hero/ module
  - Profile content structured for easy updates and management
  - Animation utilities follow lib/ directory patterns
  - Image assets optimized and organized in public/images/
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project structure supports hero implementation well
  - Need to create profile content structure for bio and skills data
  - Animation system needs hero-specific motion definitions
