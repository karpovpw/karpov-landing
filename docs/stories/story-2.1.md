# Story 2.1: Personal Profile & Hero

Status: Draft

## Story

As a potential employer or client, I want to see a compelling hero section with professional photo, bio, and skills showcase, so that I can quickly understand the developer's expertise and decide whether to explore the portfolio further.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC201: Hero Section Implementation**
   - Hero section displays professional photo with glassmorphism styling
   - Personal introduction with animated typing effect renders correctly
   - Primary call-to-action button functions and is visually prominent
   - Hero content adapts responsively across all device breakpoints
   - Hero animations perform smoothly at 60fps

2. **AC202: Personal Profile Content**
   - Professional bio section displays comprehensive background information
   - Skills and expertise tags are interactive and filterable
   - Technical competencies showcase aligns with portfolio content
   - Contact information preview is accessible and encourages engagement
   - Profile content maintains WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

3. **AC203: Visual Design Integration**
   - Hero section integrates seamlessly with liquid glass design system
   - Theme switching affects hero section appropriately (light/dark modes)
   - Responsive layout maintains visual hierarchy across breakpoints
   - Professional photo displays with proper aspect ratios and optimization
   - Glassmorphism effects enhance rather than hinder content readability

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Hero section serves as primary conversion point and brand impression
  - Content-first approach ensures accessibility and performance are prioritized
  - Glassmorphism implementation must enhance rather than hinder content visibility
  - Animation system must respect user motion preferences while engaging visitors

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/components/hero/HeroSection.tsx` - Main hero section with glassmorphism styling
  - `/components/hero/AnimatedText.tsx` - Typing animation and text effects
  - `/components/hero/SkillsShowcase.tsx` - Interactive skills and expertise display
  - `/components/hero/ProfessionalPhoto.tsx` - Optimized image component with responsive behavior
  - `/content/profile/` - Personal profile content and bio information

- Testing standards summary
  - User experience testing for first impression and conversion effectiveness
  - Animation performance testing for 60fps across different devices
  - Accessibility testing for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in hero section
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing for glassmorphism and animation effects
  - Mobile responsiveness testing for touch interaction and readability

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Hero components integrate with existing layout and design system modules
  - Content structure supports markdown-based profile information management
  - Component organization follows feature-based structure for Epic 2
  - Responsive implementation leverages 6-breakpoint grid system from Story 1.4

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - hero implementation builds naturally on Epic 1 foundation
  - Glassmorphism design enhances professional presentation without hindering accessibility
  - Animation system complements rather than competes with accessibility features
