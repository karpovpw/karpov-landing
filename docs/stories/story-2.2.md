# Story 2.2: Portfolio Projects Showcase

Status: Draft

## Story

As a potential employer or client, I want to browse and filter portfolio projects by technology stack, view detailed project information with screenshots, and interact with project elements, so that I can effectively evaluate the developer's technical skills and project quality.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC204: Project Grid and Filtering System**
   - Project cards display with consistent glassmorphism styling
   - Technology filter buttons function correctly with visual feedback
   - Projects can be filtered by multiple technology categories
   - Filter state persists during browsing session
   - Grid layout adapts responsively across all breakpoints

2. **AC205: Project Card Components**
   - Project cards show title, description, and technology tags
   - Featured projects display prominently with enhanced styling
   - Project images load with optimization and hover effects
   - Card animations perform smoothly at 60fps
   - Cards include clear call-to-action for detailed view

3. **AC206: Detailed Project View**
   - Full project details display in modal or page view
   - Project screenshots gallery with navigation controls
   - Technology stack displayed with icons and descriptions
   - Project links (demo, GitHub) function correctly
   - Related projects suggestions appear when relevant

4. **AC207: Interactive Project Features**
   - Project cards respond to hover and focus interactions
   - Filter controls provide immediate visual feedback
   - Project detail view includes smooth transitions
   - Loading states display appropriately for project content
   - Empty states handled gracefully when no projects match filters

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Project showcase serves as primary skills demonstration and client acquisition tool
  - Content management approach supports easy project additions and updates
  - Glassmorphism implementation must enhance project presentation without overwhelming content
  - Performance optimization critical for project images and filtering interactions

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/components/portfolio/ProjectGrid.tsx` - Main portfolio projects display
  - `/components/portfolio/ProjectCard.tsx` - Individual project card component
  - `/components/portfolio/ProjectDetail.tsx` - Full project detail modal/page
  - `/components/portfolio/TechnologyFilter.tsx` - Interactive filtering controls
  - `/content/projects/` - Project data and content management

- Testing standards summary
  - User experience testing for project discovery and filtering effectiveness
  - Performance testing for project image loading and grid rendering
  - Accessibility testing for project cards and filtering interactions
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing for glassmorphism project cards
  - Content management testing for easy project addition and updates

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Portfolio Module structure supports project showcase and filtering functionality
  - Content organization enables easy project management and updates
  - Component architecture follows feature-based organization for Epic 2
  - Responsive implementation leverages Epic 1's 6-breakpoint grid system

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - portfolio implementation builds naturally on Epic 1 foundation
  - Glassmorphism design enhances project presentation and visual appeal
  - Content management approach supports growth and portfolio expansion
