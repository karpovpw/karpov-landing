# Story 2.2: Portfolio Projects Showcase

Status: Draft

## Story

As a potential employer or client, I want to browse a visually appealing portfolio projects showcase with detailed project information, technology filtering, and interactive project cards, so that I can effectively evaluate the developer's technical skills, project quality, and relevant experience for potential collaboration or hiring opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Project cards display with liquid glass effects and consistent visual hierarchy
2. Technology filtering system allows browsing projects by specific tech stacks
3. Detailed project view shows comprehensive information with screenshots and descriptions
4. Project cards include interactive hover effects and smooth animations
5. Projects sorted by relevance with featured projects highlighted prominently
6. Project information includes links to live demos and source code repositories

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Build project card components
  - [ ] Create ProjectCard component with liquid glass styling and hover effects
  - [ ] Implement project thumbnail with optimized image loading
  - [ ] Add technology tags with glassmorphism badge styling
  - [ ] Set up project status indicators (featured, completed, in-progress)
- [ ] Implement project filtering by technology
  - [ ] Build FilterBar component with technology checkboxes and search
  - [ ] Create filtering logic for technology stack matching
  - [ ] Implement active filter state management with visual feedback
  - [ ] Add filter persistence across page reloads
- [ ] Create detailed project view with screenshots
  - [ ] Develop ProjectDetail modal/page with full project information
  - [ ] Implement image gallery with swipe navigation for screenshots
  - [ ] Add project description with formatted markdown content
  - [ ] Include links to live demo and GitHub repository
- [ ] Add project interaction features
  - [ ] Implement project favorite/bookmark functionality
  - [ ] Add social sharing buttons for individual projects
  - [ ] Create project comparison feature for multiple selections
  - [ ] Set up project inquiry contact form integration

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Component composition for project cards with glassmorphism styling
  - State management for filtering and project selection
  - Image optimization for project screenshots and thumbnails
  - Responsive grid layout for different device sizes
- Source tree components to touch
  - components/portfolio/ for project showcase components
  - components/filtering/ for technology filter system
  - lib/project-utils.ts for project data management
  - public/images/projects/ for project screenshots and assets
- Testing standards summary
  - Project card rendering and interaction testing across devices
  - Filtering functionality testing with various technology combinations
  - Image loading and gallery navigation performance testing
  - Accessibility testing for screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Portfolio components organized in components/portfolio/ module
  - Project data structure follows content/ organization patterns
  - Image assets optimized in public/images/projects/ structure
  - Filtering logic integrated with existing state management
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project structure supports portfolio implementation well
  - Need to create project content structure for showcase data
  - Image optimization pipeline needs project screenshot handling
