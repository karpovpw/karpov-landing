## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Article system serves as primary content showcase for BMAD thought leadership
  - Content management approach supports easy article additions and updates
  - Glassmorphism implementation enhances reading experience without overwhelming content
  - Performance optimization critical for article loading and search functionality
  - Markdown processing must handle complex technical content and code examples

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/components/content/ArticleList.tsx` - Main articles page and filtering
  - `/components/content/ArticleCard.tsx` - Individual article preview component
  - `/components/content/ArticleDetail.tsx` - Full article reading interface
  - `/components/content/ArticleSearch.tsx` - Search and filtering controls
  - `/content/articles/` - Article markdown files and metadata
  - `/lib/content.ts` - Content loading and processing utilities

- Testing standards summary
  - Content loading and rendering performance testing
  - Search and filtering functionality validation
  - Accessibility testing for article reader interface
  - Cross-browser compatibility for markdown rendering
  - Content management workflow usability testing

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Content Module structure supports article management and display functionality
  - Component architecture follows feature-based organization for Epic 2
  - Content organization enables easy article management and SEO optimization
