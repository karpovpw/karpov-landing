# Story 2.3: Articles Management System

Status: Draft

## Story

As a knowledge seeker or developer, I want to access a well-organized articles management system with filtering, search, and reading time estimates, so that I can easily discover and consume high-quality technical content about BMAD methodologies, blockchain technology, and software architecture best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Article listing displays with glassmorphism cards and consistent metadata presentation
2. Topic-based filtering allows browsing articles by BMAD, blockchain, architecture, tutorials
3. Publication date sorting works with newest/oldest options and featured article highlighting
4. Reading time estimates calculated accurately based on content length and complexity
5. Article detail view renders markdown content with proper formatting and navigation
6. Article cards include social sharing capabilities and reading progress indicators

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create article listing and filtering
  - [ ] Build ArticleCard component with glassmorphism styling and metadata
  - [ ] Implement ArticleGrid component with responsive layout
  - [ ] Create FilterSidebar for topic-based filtering and search
  - [ ] Add sorting controls for date and reading time
- [ ] Build article detail view with markdown support
  - [ ] Develop ArticleReader component with markdown rendering
  - [ ] Implement reading progress indicator and scroll navigation
  - [ ] Add syntax highlighting for code blocks in articles
  - [ ] Create table of contents generation from article headings
- [ ] Implement publication date sorting
  - [ ] Build date sorting logic with newest/oldest options
  - [ ] Implement featured article highlighting and pinning
  - [ ] Add publication status management (draft, published, featured)
  - [ ] Create article metadata management system
- [ ] Add reading time estimates
  - [ ] Implement reading time calculation algorithm
  - [ ] Create visual reading time indicators and badges
  - [ ] Add estimated completion time for different reading speeds
  - [ ] Integrate reading time into article metadata

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Content management system for markdown-based articles
  - Glassmorphism design integration with content presentation
  - Performance optimization for article loading and markdown rendering
  - Responsive layout for article consumption across devices
- Source tree components to touch
  - components/content/ for article display and management components
  - components/articles/ for article-specific UI elements
  - lib/content-utils.ts for markdown processing and content management
  - content/articles/ for article markdown files and metadata
- Testing standards summary
  - Article rendering and markdown processing testing
  - Filtering and sorting functionality testing across content types
  - Reading time calculation accuracy testing
  - Accessibility testing for article content and navigation

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Content components organized in components/content/ module
  - Article data structured in content/articles/ with markdown format
  - Content utilities follow lib/ directory conventions
  - Article assets organized for optimal loading performance
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project structure supports content management well
  - Need to create article content structure and markdown processing
  - Content filtering system needs integration with existing state management
