### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

[✓] Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Evidence: Present in <story> section with correct structure: "As a performance engineer... I want... so that..."
[✓] Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Evidence: All 6 criteria match story-1.5.md exactly: AC001-AC006 with Core Web Vitals focus
[✓] Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Evidence: 4 main tasks included in <tasks> element: code splitting, image optimization, caching strategies, performance monitoring
[✓] Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Evidence: 2 documentation references with specific sections: solution-architecture.md (Performance Optimization), tech-spec-epic-1.md (AC005 Performance)
[✓] Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Evidence: 4 performance-related files referenced (next.config.js, LazySection.tsx, performance.ts, image-optimization.ts) with optimization reasons and line numbers
[✓] Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
Evidence: PerformanceMonitor and ImageOptimizer interfaces documented with signatures and paths
[✓] Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
Evidence: 6 constraints covering bundle size targets, image optimization, caching strategies, Core Web Vitals tracking, loading performance, animation performance
[✓] Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Evidence: Node.js ecosystem with bundle analyzer, webpack analyzer, image optimization, and service worker dependencies for performance monitoring
[✓] Testing standards and locations populated
Evidence: Performance testing, bundle analysis testing, image optimization testing, caching strategy testing with specific locations including Lighthouse CI
[✓] XML structure follows story-context template format
Evidence: Complete structure matches template.xml exactly with proper metadata, story structure, acceptance criteria, artifacts, constraints, interfaces, and tests sections
