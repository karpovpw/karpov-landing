# Story 1.6: Accessibility Foundation

Status: Draft

## Story

As an accessibility specialist, I want to implement comprehensive accessibility features including ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility, so that I can ensure the portfolio website meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards and provides an inclusive experience for all users regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ARIA labels implemented for all interactive glassmorphism elements and complex UI components
2. Keyboard navigation works for all theme switching, navigation, and interactive elements
3. Screen reader compatibility validated for glassmorphism content and dynamic elements
4. Color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards in both light and dark themes
5. Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements with proper focus management
6. Semantic HTML structure implemented throughout the application with proper heading hierarchy

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement ARIA labels and semantic HTML
  - [ ] Add comprehensive ARIA labels for all interactive glassmorphism elements
  - [ ] Implement semantic HTML5 elements (nav, main, section, article)
  - [ ] Set up proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) for content structure
  - [ ] Add landmark roles for screen reader navigation
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation support
  - [ ] Implement full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
  - [ ] Set up proper tab order and focus management
  - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for theme switching and navigation
  - [ ] Ensure skip links for main content areas
- [ ] Set up screen reader compatibility
  - [ ] Add descriptive alt text for all images and icons
  - [ ] Implement live regions for dynamic content updates
  - [ ] Set up proper labeling for form elements and controls
  - [ ] Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Validate color contrast ratios
  - [ ] Ensure 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio for normal text in both themes
  - [ ] Validate 3:1 minimum contrast ratio for large text
  - [ ] Implement theme-aware contrast checking utilities
  - [ ] Set up automated contrast validation in build process

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as foundational requirement
  - Semantic HTML with proper ARIA implementation
  - Keyboard-first navigation patterns with focus management
  - Screen reader optimization for dynamic content and glassmorphism
- Source tree components to touch
  - components/design-system/ for accessible glassmorphism components
  - components/layout/ for keyboard-navigable layout structures
  - lib/accessibility-utils.ts for focus management and ARIA utilities
  - styles/accessibility.css for focus indicators and high contrast support
- Testing standards summary
  - Automated accessibility testing with axe-core (100% coverage target)
  - Keyboard navigation testing across all interactive elements
  - Screen reader compatibility testing with multiple assistive technologies
  - Color contrast validation with automated reporting

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Accessibility utilities integrated into lib/ directory structure
  - ARIA implementation follows component design patterns
  - Focus management utilities follow established patterns
  - Accessibility testing integrated into component test suites
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project structure supports accessibility implementation well
  - Need to enhance glassmorphism components with ARIA support
  - Component props need accessibility-focused type definitions
