# Story 2.5: Crypto Project Showcase

Status: Draft

## Story

As a blockchain enthusiast or potential collaborator, I want to explore dedicated crypto project showcases with enhanced visual presentation and blockchain-specific features, so that I can understand the technical depth and innovation in blockchain projects and make informed decisions about potential partnerships.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dedicated crypto project section displays with enhanced visual design
2. Blockchain-specific metadata shows clearly (networks, tokens, TVL)
3. Interactive crypto project features work smoothly with real-time data
4. Enhanced visual presentation highlights blockchain innovation aspects
5. Project cards show relevant blockchain metrics and statistics
6. Integration with blockchain data sources provides current information

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Crypto components organized in components/crypto/ module
  - Blockchain utilities follow lib/ directory conventions
  - DeFi integrations structured for security and maintainability
  - Real-time data handling follows existing state management patterns
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project structure supports crypto functionality well
  - Need to create blockchain-specific component patterns
  - Real-time data integration needs performance optimization
  - Security considerations for wallet and DeFi interactions
