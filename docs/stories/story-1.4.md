# Story 1.4: Responsive Layout Framework

Status: Draft

## Story

As a user, I want the portfolio to display perfectly and function seamlessly across all devices and screen sizes, so that I can access the content comfortably whether I'm using a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC004: Responsive Layout Framework**
   - CSS Grid system implements 6-breakpoint responsive design
   - Mobile-first approach validated across all breakpoints
   - Layout containers use liquid glass effects appropriately
   - Grid system supports planned component layouts
   - Responsive images scale appropriately across devices

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC004): Implement 6-breakpoint responsive grid system
  - [ ] Create CSS Grid system with 6 breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 1920px)
  - [ ] Implement mobile-first responsive design approach
  - [ ] Set up CSS custom properties for breakpoint management
  - [ ] Create responsive grid utility classes and mixins
  - [ ] Test grid system across all breakpoint transitions

- [ ] Task 2 (AC004): Build responsive layout containers and components
  - [ ] Implement flexible container components with glassmorphism integration
  - [ ] Create responsive layout components (Header, Footer, Main, Aside)
  - [ ] Build mobile navigation drawer with slide-in glassmorphism effects
  - [ ] Develop responsive grid-based page layouts
  - [ ] Ensure layout containers adapt appropriately to glassmorphism design system

- [ ] Task 3 (AC004): Integrate responsive design with existing systems
  - [ ] Integrate responsive breakpoints with theme system (light/dark themes)
  - [ ] Ensure glassmorphism effects work consistently across all breakpoints
  - [ ] Test responsive layout integration with project structure from Story 1.1
  - [ ] Validate responsive behavior with liquid glass design system from Story 1.2
  - [ ] Confirm responsive compatibility with theme system from Story 1.3

- [ ] Task 4 (AC004): Implement responsive media and content scaling
  - [ ] Set up responsive image optimization with Next.js Image component
  - [ ] Implement responsive typography scaling across breakpoints
  - [ ] Create responsive content containers with appropriate spacing
  - [ ] Ensure touch-friendly interaction targets on mobile devices
  - [ ] Test responsive content presentation across all device sizes

- [ ] Task 5 (AC004): Validate cross-device consistency and performance
  - [ ] Test layout consistency across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - [ ] Validate touch interaction quality on mobile and tablet devices
  - [ ] Ensure responsive images load and scale appropriately
  - [ ] Test layout performance across different device capabilities
  - [ ] Confirm responsive design meets accessibility requirements

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Mobile-first responsive strategy ensures optimal experience across all devices
  - CSS Grid system provides flexible layout foundation for component-based design
  - Container queries support fluid layouts that adapt to content and viewport
  - Touch optimization ensures 44px minimum tap targets and swipe gesture support

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/components/layout/` - Layout and navigation components with responsive behavior
  - `/styles/responsive.css` - Responsive grid system and breakpoint definitions
  - `/styles/containers.css` - Flexible container components with glassmorphism
  - `/components/layout/Grid.tsx` - Responsive grid system implementation
  - `/components/layout/Container.tsx` - Flexible layout container with glass effects

- Testing standards summary
  - Cross-device testing across 6 breakpoints on mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - Touch interaction testing for mobile-first design validation
  - Visual regression testing for layout consistency across breakpoints
  - Performance testing for responsive layout rendering and transitions
  - Accessibility testing for touch targets and screen reader compatibility

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Layout Module structure supports responsive grid system and container components
  - CSS architecture enables breakpoint-specific styling with theme integration
  - Component organization follows atomic design with responsive behavior built-in
  - Integration with existing design system ensures consistent glassmorphism across breakpoints

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - responsive layout implementation aligns with architecture specifications
  - Mobile-first approach provides optimal foundation for progressive enhancement
  - Grid system design supports both current and planned component layouts
