# Story 1.4: Responsive Layout Framework

Status: Draft

## Story

As a frontend architect, I want to create a mobile-first responsive layout framework with flexible grid system and breakpoint management, so that I can ensure consistent, accessible, and performant user experiences across all device sizes while maintaining the portfolio's liquid glass design aesthetic.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CSS Grid system implements 6-breakpoint responsive design (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 1920px)
2. Mobile-first approach validated across all breakpoints with touch-friendly interactions
3. Layout containers use liquid glass effects appropriately with adaptive glassmorphism
4. Grid system supports planned component layouts for portfolio, articles, and projects
5. Responsive images scale appropriately across devices with optimized loading
6. Touch interactions work seamlessly with 44px minimum tap targets

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create mobile-first responsive grid system
  - [ ] Implement 6-breakpoint CSS Grid system with mobile-first approach
  - [ ] Create responsive container components with max-width constraints
  - [ ] Set up fluid typography scaling across breakpoints
  - [ ] Implement responsive spacing system with consistent vertical rhythm
- [ ] Implement breakpoint management
  - [ ] Create breakpoint constants and utility functions
  - [ ] Implement useBreakpoint hook for responsive behavior
  - [ ] Set up media query system for component-level responsive design
  - [ ] Create responsive utility classes for common layout patterns
- [ ] Build flexible container and layout components
  - [ ] Develop Grid container component with glassmorphism styling
  - [ ] Create Flex container variants for different layout needs
  - [ ] Implement Stack component for vertical spacing consistency
  - [ ] Build responsive navigation layout components
- [ ] Ensure cross-device consistency
  - [ ] Validate layout consistency across mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - [ ] Implement touch-friendly interaction patterns for mobile
  - [ ] Optimize glassmorphism effects for different screen densities
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works across all breakpoints
- [ ] Performance optimization for responsive design
  - [ ] Implement responsive image loading with appropriate sizes
  - [ ] Set up lazy loading for below-fold content on mobile
  - [ ] Optimize CSS delivery for different breakpoints
  - [ ] Monitor layout shift scores across devices

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layout systems
  - Container queries for fluid component-level responsive design
  - Touch optimization with appropriate tap target sizes
- Source tree components to touch
  - components/layout/ for grid system and container components
  - components/design-system/ for responsive glassmorphism components
  - styles/responsive.css for breakpoint-specific styling
  - lib/responsive-utils.ts for breakpoint management utilities
- Testing standards summary
  - Cross-device testing across 6 breakpoints (90% coverage target)
  - Touch interaction testing for mobile and tablet devices
  - Layout consistency testing with visual regression
  - Performance testing for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) optimization

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Layout components organized in components/layout/ module
  - Responsive utilities follow lib/ directory conventions
  - CSS organization supports breakpoint-specific styling
  - Grid system integrates with design-system glassmorphism components
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project has basic page structure but missing responsive grid system
  - Need to implement breakpoint management system for glassmorphism adaptation
  - Component structure needs layout module foundation for consistent spacing
