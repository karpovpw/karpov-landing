# Story 1.2: Liquid Glass Design System

Status: Draft

## Story

As a frontend developer, I want to implement the liquid glass design system with CSS architecture and reusable glassmorphism components, so that the portfolio has a distinctive visual identity with smooth glass effects and consistent styling across all pages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC002: Liquid Glass Design System**
   - CSS custom properties system implements glassmorphism tokens
   - GlassCard component renders with backdrop-filter blur effects
   - Glass morphism works across different theme configurations
   - Component library structure follows atomic design principles
   - CSS architecture supports theme switching without FOUC

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC002): Set up CSS custom properties system
  - [ ] Create CSS custom properties for glassmorphism tokens (blur, opacity, border, shadow)
  - [ ] Implement theme-aware CSS variables for light and dark themes
  - [ ] Set up PostCSS configuration for custom property processing
  - [ ] Create glassmorphism.css with foundational effect definitions
  - [ ] Validate CSS custom properties load correctly in both themes

- [x] Task 2 (AC002): Build foundational GlassCard component
  - [ ] Create GlassCard.tsx with backdrop-filter blur effects
  - [ ] Implement configurable glassmorphism properties (blur, opacity, border)
  - [ ] Add theme-aware styling with CSS custom properties integration
  - [ ] Build responsive GlassCard variants for different use cases
  - [ ] Test backdrop-filter rendering across supported browsers

- [x] Task 3 (AC002): Implement glassmorphism component library structure
  - [ ] Set up design-system/ directory structure following atomic design
  - [ ] Create base glassmorphism utility functions and mixins
  - [ ] Build reusable glassmorphism components (GlassContainer, GlassPanel, GlassButton)
  - [ ] Implement component library following atomic design principles
  - [ ] Create component documentation and Storybook configuration

- [x] Task 4 (AC002): Ensure theme compatibility and smooth transitions
  - [ ] Test glassmorphism effects in light theme (white/purple gradient)
  - [ ] Test glassmorphism effects in dark theme (AMOLED black)
  - [ ] Implement smooth theme transitions (< 200ms) for glass effects
  - [ ] Prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) during theme switches
  - [ ] Validate glass effects work with neon accent colors (green/orange)

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Glassmorphism CSS architecture leverages backdrop-filter for modern glass effects
  - CSS Modules provide component-scoped styling for glassmorphism encapsulation
  - Atomic design principles ensure scalable and maintainable component library
  - Theme system integration requires smooth transitions without visual disruption

- Source tree components to touch
  - `/styles/glassmorphism.css` - Foundational glass effect definitions and CSS architecture
  - `/components/design-system/` - Atomic design component library structure
  - `/components/design-system/GlassCard.tsx` - Base liquid glass container component
  - `/styles/themes.css` - Theme-specific glassmorphism styling and transitions
  - `/lib/animations.ts` - Framer Motion configurations for glassmorphism effects

- Testing standards summary
  - Visual regression testing for glassmorphism effects across themes
  - Component unit testing with React Testing Library for glass components
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing for backdrop-filter support
  - Performance testing for 60fps glassmorphism animations
  - Accessibility testing for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with glass effects

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Design System Module (@/design-system) structure follows atomic design methodology
  - CSS architecture supports component isolation while enabling theme switching
  - Component naming follows PascalCase convention (GlassCard, GlassContainer)
  - Style organization separates glassmorphism effects from general styling

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - No conflicts detected - glassmorphism implementation aligns with architecture specifications
  - CSS custom properties approach enables runtime theme switching as designed
  - Component library structure provides foundation for Epic 2 feature components
