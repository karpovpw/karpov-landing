# Story 1.2: Liquid Glass Design System Implementation

Status: Draft

## Story

As a frontend developer, I want to implement a comprehensive liquid glass design system with glassmorphism effects and reusable component library, so that I can create visually stunning and consistent UI components with iOS 26-like fluent animations throughout the portfolio website.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CSS design system implements liquid glass effects with backdrop-filter and glassmorphism tokens
2. GlassCard component renders with proper backdrop-filter blur effects in both themes
3. Glass morphism works consistently across different theme configurations (light/dark)
4. Component library structure follows atomic design principles with reusable patterns
5. CSS architecture supports theme switching without FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create CSS design system with liquid glass effects
  - [ ] Implement CSS custom properties system for glassmorphism tokens
  - [ ] Create glassmorphism utility classes for Tailwind CSS
  - [ ] Set up design tokens for blur, opacity, border, and shadow values
  - [ ] Configure CSS architecture for theme-aware glass effects
- [ ] Implement glassmorphism components library
  - [ ] Build foundational GlassCard component with backdrop-filter effects
  - [ ] Create GlassButton component with hover animations
  - [ ] Implement GlassContainer for layout sections
  - [ ] Develop GlassNavigation component for header/menu
- [ ] Build reusable UI component patterns
  - [ ] Create atomic design component structure (atoms, molecules, organisms)
  - [ ] Implement component composition patterns for complex UI elements
  - [ ] Build template components for consistent page layouts
  - [ ] Develop component props interfaces for flexibility
- [ ] Set up design tokens and variables
  - [ ] Define comprehensive design token system for colors, spacing, typography
  - [ ] Create theme-aware token variables for light/dark modes
  - [ ] Implement token propagation across component library
  - [ ] Set up design token documentation and usage guidelines
- [ ] Testing framework setup for design system
  - [ ] Create visual regression tests for glassmorphism effects
  - [ ] Implement component unit tests with theme switching
  - [ ] Set up accessibility testing for glassmorphism components
  - [ ] Create performance tests for animation rendering

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Atomic design methodology for component library organization
  - CSS-in-CSS architecture for glassmorphism with hardware acceleration
  - Theme-aware component design for seamless light/dark transitions
  - Performance-first animation patterns with reduced motion support
- Source tree components to touch
  - components/design-system/ for foundational glassmorphism components
  - styles/ for global glassmorphism CSS and theme definitions
  - lib/ for design tokens and animation utilities
  - types/ for component prop interfaces and theme types
- Testing standards summary
  - Visual regression testing for glassmorphism consistency (90% coverage target)
  - Component integration tests for theme switching functionality
  - Accessibility testing for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with glass effects
  - Performance testing for 60fps animations on mobile devices

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Component organization follows atomic design in components/design-system/
  - CSS architecture uses CSS Modules + Tailwind for glassmorphism effects
  - Design tokens centralized in lib/design-tokens.ts for consistency
  - Animation utilities in lib/animations.ts for reusable motion patterns
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - Current project has basic Tailwind setup but missing glassmorphism implementation
  - Need to extend CSS architecture with backdrop-filter and glassmorphism utilities
  - Component structure needs design system foundation before feature components
