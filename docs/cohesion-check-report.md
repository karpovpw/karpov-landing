     ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓        ↓
Stories 1.3-1.6  Stories 2.1-2.6      Stories 2.3-2.6  All Stories  Deploy
need approval    depend on Epic 1    ready for dev    completed    Complete
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Complete Epic 1 Foundation**
   - Finish remaining Stories 1.2-1.6
   - Ensure design system is fully implemented
   - Validate responsive framework across all breakpoints

2. **Approve Stories for Development**
   - Review and approve Stories 1.3-1.6 and 2.1-2.2
   - Generate story context for approved stories
   - Enable development workflow execution

3. **Parallel Development Opportunity**
   - Stories 2.3-2.6 are ready for immediate development
   - Can proceed in parallel with Epic 1 completion
   - Should be prioritized for faster time-to-market

### Quality Improvements
1. **Enhanced Validation** - Add explicit project level determination (0-4)
2. **Process Documentation** - Document user approval and decision processes
3. **Risk Mitigation** - Implement performance monitoring for liquid glass effects
4. **Content Strategy** - Prepare project and article content for Epic 2

### Success Criteria
- **Foundation Completion:** All Epic 1 stories completed and tested
- **Feature Delivery:** Stories 2.3-2.6 implemented and validated
- **Performance Achievement:** NFR001 and NFR002 targets met
- **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA validation passed

## Validation Status

**Cohesion Check Result:** ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**

**Readiness Score:** 61% (Architecture complete, implementation needs foundation)

**Critical Path:** Complete Epic 1 → Implement Stories 2.3-2.6 → Complete remaining Epic 2 features

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks for Epic 1 completion, 1-2 weeks for prioritized Epic 2 features
