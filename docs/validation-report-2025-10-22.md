## Failed Items
1. Story readiness assessed (X of Y ready) - Missing quantitative score
2. 100% FR coverage - Not quantified
3. 100% NFR coverage - Not quantified
4. 100% epic coverage - Not quantified
5. Readiness score - Missing score

## Partial Items
1. 100% FR coverage OR gaps documented - Implied but not explicit
2. 100% NFR coverage OR gaps documented - Enhanced but not percentage
3. 100% epic coverage OR gaps documented - Confirmed but no number
4. Readiness score - No score provided

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Add quantitative coverage percentages for FR, NFR, epic, story readiness in next revision.
2. Should Improve: Include explicit readiness score in document.
3. Consider: Run specialist workflows if placeholders are to be expanded.
