# Sprint Change Proposal

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Author:** Product Manager (BMAD)
**Change Trigger:** Contact page is broken, needs rebuild with more liquid glass reposition elements, responsive.

## Section 1: Issue Summary

The contact page implementation does not meet user expectations. The current design is not appealing, and the user wants to rebuild it with enhanced liquid glass effects, reposition elements, and ensure it looks good on both web and mobile.

**Context:** User feedback during review of the contact page functionality.

**Evidence:** User statement: "contact page is still broken. I don't like it anyway, let's rebuild it, add more liquid glass reposition elements. Make sure it looks good on both web and mobile"

## Section 2: Impact Analysis

**Epic Impact:**
- Epic 2 (Content & User Features): Affected, needs modification to story-2.4 (Contact and networking integration).

**Story Impact:** Story-2.4 needs update to include new design requirements.

**Artifact Conflicts:**
- PRD: No major conflict, but may need update for new UI requirements.
- Architecture: The glass design system is already in place, no conflict.
- UI/UX: Needs update to incorporate liquid glass effects and responsive design.

**Technical Impact:** Need to enhance the contact page components with liquid glass effects, reposition elements, and ensure responsive design.

## Section 3: Recommended Approach

**Selected Path:** Direct Adjustment - Modify the existing contact story to add the new features.

**Rationale:** The foundation is solid with the glass design system. Enhancing the contact page will achieve the desired outcome without major restructuring. Effort is medium, risk is low, and it maintains project momentum.

**Trade-offs:** Additional time for design and implementation, but improves user satisfaction.

**Alternatives Considered:** Rollback not viable, MVP review not needed.
