# Sprint Change Proposal

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Author:** Product Manager (BMAD)
**Change Trigger:** Issues with current implementation not matching requirements

## Section 1: Issue Summary

The current implementation of the Karpov portfolio website shows a mismatch between the defined requirements in the PRD and the actual development status. While the architecture and design system are well-defined and partially implemented, the individual stories remain in draft status, leading to incomplete features and potential delays in delivering the full portfolio experience.

**Context:** The project has a complete PRD with 15 functional requirements, 5 non-functional requirements, and 12 stories across 2 epics. The solution architecture is 85.7% validated, but story readiness is low, with all stories marked as "Draft" despite some foundational components being implemented.

**Evidence:** Validation reports indicate missing quantitative coverage scores, and code review shows implemented components like GlassCard, ThemeProvider, and HeroSection, but incomplete story execution.

## Section 2: Impact Analysis

**Epic Impact:**
- Epic 1 (Core Infrastructure & Design System): Partially implemented (design system components done, but stories not completed).
- Epic 2 (Content & User Features): Stories in draft, minimal implementation.

**Story Impact:** All 12 stories are in draft status, requiring completion to match PRD requirements.

**Artifact Conflicts:**
- PRD: Goals aligned, but implementation incomplete.
- Architecture: Designed but needs full implementation.
- UI/UX: Specifications defined but not fully realized.

**Technical Impact:** Code exists for core components, but full feature set not integrated.

## Section 3: Recommended Approach

**Selected Path:** Direct Adjustment - Modify and complete existing stories within the current epic structure.

**Rationale:** The foundation is solid with implemented components. Completing the stories will achieve the PRD goals without major restructuring. Effort is medium, risk is low, and it maintains project momentum.

**Trade-offs:** Delays in completion if not prioritized, but no major scope changes needed.

**Alternatives Considered:** Rollback not viable (no unnecessary work), MVP review not needed (scope achievable).

## Section 4: Detailed Change Proposals

**Story Changes:**
- Complete all 12 stories from draft to implemented status.
- Integrate existing components (GlassCard, ThemeProvider) into full features.
- Add missing implementations for portfolio, articles, contact, etc.

**PRD Modifications:** None required - current PRD aligns with architecture.

**Architecture Changes:** None - architecture is sound, needs execution.

**UI/UX Updates:** Complete responsive design and animations as per specs.

## Section 5: Implementation Handoff

**Change Scope:** Moderate - Requires backlog reorganization and team coordination.

**Handoff Recipients:** Development team for implementation, Product Owner for backlog management.

**Responsibilities:**
- Development: Complete story implementations.
- PO: Prioritize backlog and track progress.
- PM: Monitor alignment with PRD.

**Success Criteria:** All stories completed, full portfolio functional, validation reports updated.

**Timeline Impact:** 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on team availability.
