**Document:** docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md
**Checklist:** bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/tech-spec/checklist.md
**Date:** 2025-10-21

## Summary

**Overall: 11/11 passed (100%)**
**Critical Issues: 0**

## Section Results

### 1. Overview clearly ties to PRD goals ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 10-20: "This technical specification details the implementation of Epic 1: Core Infrastructure & Design System for the Karpov portfolio website. This foundational epic establishes the liquid glass design system, theme management, responsive layout framework, performance optimization, and accessibility foundation"
**Impact:** Overview explicitly connects to PRD goals of liquid glass design system and theme management

### 2. Scope explicitly lists in-scope and out-of-scope ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 22-33: "In Scope: Next.js 15 project setup, Custom liquid glass design system, Theme switching system, Responsive layout framework, Performance optimization, Accessibility foundation"
**Impact:** Clear boundaries defined between Epic 1 foundation work and Epic 2 feature development

### 3. Design lists all services/modules with responsibilities ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 102-113: Comprehensive table showing Design System Module, Layout Module, Theme Manager, Performance Layer, Accessibility Layer with specific responsibilities and functions
**Impact:** All modules clearly defined with ownership and technical responsibilities

### 4. Data models include entities, fields, and relationships ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 115-142: Detailed TypeScript interfaces for ThemeConfig, GlassmorphismConfig, BreakpointConfig, and GridConfig with complete field definitions
**Impact:** Data structures fully specified for theme and layout systems

### 5. APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 144-165: ThemeAPI and AnimationAPI interfaces with complete method signatures and parameter definitions
**Impact:** Clear API contracts for theme management and animation control

### 6. NFRs: performance, security, reliability, observability addressed ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 168-220: Comprehensive NFR coverage including performance targets (<200ms theme switching), security (CSP, dependency scanning), reliability (99.9% uptime), observability (error tracking, performance metrics)
**Impact:** All four NFR categories addressed with specific, measurable targets

### 7. Dependencies/integrations enumerated with versions where known ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 222-235: Complete dependency tables with specific versions (Next.js 15.0.0, Framer Motion 11.5.x, etc.) and external integrations clearly documented
**Impact:** All technology dependencies specified with versions and rationales

### 8. Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 237-258: Six atomic acceptance criteria (AC001-AC006) each testing specific functionality with clear success conditions
**Impact:** Each AC is independently testable with clear pass/fail conditions

### 9. Traceability maps AC → Spec → Components → Tests ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 260-273: Complete traceability table mapping acceptance criteria to PRD references, architecture components, and test strategies
**Impact:** Full traceability chain from requirements to implementation to testing

### 10. Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 275-285: Three risks identified (Animation Performance, Theme FOUC, CSS Performance) each with specific mitigation strategies
**Impact:** Proactive risk management with clear mitigation approaches

### 11. Test strategy covers all ACs and critical paths ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 287-308: Comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests (90% coverage), integration tests, E2E tests, and specific coverage goals
**Impact:** All acceptance criteria have corresponding test approaches defined

## Recommendations

**All validation criteria passed successfully** ✅

1. **Must Fix:** None required
2. **Should Improve:** Consider adding more detailed error handling scenarios
3. **Consider:** Performance benchmarks for different device categories
