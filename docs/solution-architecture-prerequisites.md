## 🎨 UX/UI Complexity Assessment

### Design System Requirements
**Visual Complexity:** High
- Custom liquid glass effects (iOS 26-like glassmorphism)
- Dual theme system (white with purple gradient + AMOLED black)
- Neon accent colors (green/orange instead of traditional red/green)
- Ultra-minimalist interface with KISS principle

**Animation Complexity:** High
- 60fps liquid glass animations
- 200ms theme switching transitions
- Micro-interactions for all user actions
- Progressive enhancement for performance

**Responsive Complexity:** High
- 6 breakpoint responsive system
- Mobile-first approach with touch optimization
- Adaptive liquid glass effects by screen size
- Performance optimization per device capability

### Component Architecture Needs
**Custom Component Library Required:**
- GlassCard, HeroSection, ProjectShowcase, ArticleReader
- ThemeToggle, ContactForm, Navigation, SearchComponent
- All components need glassmorphism state management
- Performance optimization for animation-heavy interactions

## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern Recommendations

### Suggested Architecture Style
**Primary Recommendation:** Modern Web Application (SPA/SSR Hybrid)
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) for optimal performance and SEO
- **Rationale:** Balances complexity with portfolio requirements, excellent for animations

**Alternative Options:**
- **React SPA:** Simpler but less SEO-optimized
- **SvelteKit:** Smaller bundle size but less ecosystem support
- **Nuxt 3:** Vue.js alternative with excellent performance

### Suggested Repository Strategy
**Primary Recommendation:** Monorepo
- **Rationale:** Simplicity for solo developer, all code in one place
- **Structure:** `/src` for components, `/public` for assets, `/docs` for documentation

**Alternative Options:**
- **Polyrepo:** If planning to extract crypto project as separate service
- **Hybrid:** Content in one repo, components in another

## ❓ Known vs Unknown Technical Decisions

### ✅ What's Already Specified
**Definite Requirements:**
- Custom liquid glass design system (from UX spec)
- Dual theme support (white/purple gradient + AMOLED black)
- Neon accent colors (green/orange) instead of traditional red/green
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design with 6 breakpoints
- iOS 26-like fluent animations (200ms transitions, 60fps)
- Performance requirements (sub-2s load, 99.9% uptime)

**Content Structure:**
- Personal profile with photo and bio
- Portfolio projects with technology filtering
- BMAD articles with topic categorization
- Crypto project showcase (separate section)
- Contact forms with LinkedIn integration
- Newsletter signup functionality

### ❓ What Needs Technical Decisions
**Technology Stack (Choose One Path):**
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js vs React SPA vs SvelteKit vs Remix
- **Styling Approach:** CSS Modules vs Styled Components vs Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Context vs Zustand vs Redux Toolkit
- **Animation Library:** Framer Motion vs React Spring vs CSS-only
- **TypeScript:** Required for component library complexity

**Development Infrastructure:**
- **Build Tool:** Vite vs Create React App vs Next.js built-in
