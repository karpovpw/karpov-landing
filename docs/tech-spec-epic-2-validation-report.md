## Summary

**Overall: 11/11 passed (100%)**
**Critical Issues: 0**

## Section Results

### 1. Overview clearly ties to PRD goals ✅ PASS

**Impact:** Overview explicitly connects to PRD user journey goals and content requirements

### 2. Scope explicitly lists in-scope and out-of-scope ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 22-35: "In Scope: Hero section, Portfolio projects showcase, BMAD articles system, Contact form, Crypto project showcase, Search functionality, Social media sharing"
**Impact:** Clear boundaries defined between content features and technical infrastructure

### 3. Design lists all services/modules with responsibilities ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 102-113: Comprehensive table showing Hero Module, Portfolio Module, Content Module, Contact Module, Search Module with specific responsibilities and functions
**Impact:** All feature modules clearly defined with ownership and technical responsibilities

### 4. Data models include entities, fields, and relationships ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 115-150: Detailed TypeScript interfaces for ProjectData, ArticleData, ContactFormData with complete field definitions and relationships
**Impact:** Content data structures fully specified for portfolio and article management

### 5. APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 152-180: ContentAPI and ContactAPI interfaces with complete method signatures, parameter definitions, and return types
**Impact:** Clear API contracts for content management and form submission

### 6. NFRs: performance, security, reliability, observability addressed ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 182-220: Comprehensive NFR coverage including content load times (<500ms), form security (sanitization, CSRF), content reliability (99.9% availability), and engagement monitoring
**Impact:** All four NFR categories addressed with content-specific, measurable targets

### 7. Dependencies/integrations enumerated with versions where known ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 222-245: Complete dependency tables with specific versions (gray-matter 4.0.x, remark 15.x, etc.) and external service integrations clearly documented
**Impact:** All content processing and external service dependencies specified

### 8. Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 247-275: Six atomic acceptance criteria (AC201-AC206) each testing specific functionality with clear, independently testable conditions
**Impact:** Each AC is independently testable with clear pass/fail conditions

### 9. Traceability maps AC → Spec → Components → Tests ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 277-290: Complete traceability table mapping acceptance criteria to PRD references, feature modules, and test strategies
**Impact:** Full traceability chain from user requirements to technical implementation

### 10. Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 292-302: Three content-specific risks identified (Content Performance, Search Complexity, Form Spam) each with specific mitigation strategies
**Impact:** Proactive risk management for content-heavy application features

### 11. Test strategy covers all ACs and critical paths ✅ PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 304-325: Comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests (90% coverage), integration tests for content workflows, E2E tests for user journeys, and performance testing
**Impact:** All acceptance criteria and user journeys have corresponding test approaches

## Recommendations

**All validation criteria passed successfully** ✅

1. **Must Fix:** None required
2. **Should Improve:** Consider adding content performance benchmarks for large markdown files
3. **Consider:** Search relevance tuning and A/B testing for user engagement
